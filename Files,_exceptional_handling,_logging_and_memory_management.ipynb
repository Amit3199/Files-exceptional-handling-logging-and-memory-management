        "    Guaranteed File Closure:\n",

        "     Without with, a programmer must explicitly call file.close() to release the file resource. If an exception occurs before close() is called, the file might remain open, leading to resource leaks or potential data corruption. The with statement, by utilizing context managers, guarantees that the file's __exit__ method is called upon exiting the with block, regardless of how the block is exited (normal completion or exception).\n",

        "     -> Multithreading and multiprocessing are two different approaches to parallelism, both aimed at improving performance, but they differ in how they achieve this and the resources they utilize. Multithreading involves creating multiple threads within a single process, enabling concurrency, while multiprocessing involves running multiple independent processes, each with its own memory space.\n",

        "   * Use the try Block:\n",

        "       While Python's automatic memory management (through reference counting and garbage collection) simplifies development, understanding its principles allows developers to write more memory-efficient code.

        "      Preventing Memory Leaks:\n",
        "\n",
        "      Although Python aims to prevent memory leaks by automatically reclaiming unused memory, certain programming patterns can still lead to objects not being properly released. Understanding how Python manages memory helps identify and resolve such issues, ensuring that programs don't consume ever-increasing amounts of RAM.\n",

        "      Debugging Memory-Related Issues:\n",
        "\n",
        "      When a Python program experiences performance degradation or crashes due to excessive memory usage, knowledge of memory management is essential for effective debugging. This includes understanding how objects are allocated, how reference counts work, and how the garbage collector operates.\n",

        "      Optimizing Resource Usage:\n",
        "\n",

        "  14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "      -> In exception handling, try and except blocks work together to gracefully handle errors that might occur during program execution. The try block contains code that might potentially raise an exception, while the except block contains the code that executes if an exception occurs within the try block.\n",

        "  16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "       -> In exception handling, the else block is executed only if no exceptions are raised within the try block. It allows you to execute code that should run when the try block completes successfully, separating it from the exception handling code.\n",
